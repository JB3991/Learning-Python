# Classes

Learning how to create a class and add methods and Attritubes 


Start off by creating a class called car. 
```
class Car():
```

We can then add Attritubes to the Car class. 

```
class Car():
  seats = 5
  window_mirrors = 2
  tyres = "All weather Tyres"
```

We can then add a method to the class which would change the attritubes 
```
class Car():
  seats = 5
  window_mirrors = 2
  tyres = "All weather Tyres"
  
  def racing_mode_on():
    seats = 2
    tyres = "Racing Tyres"
```
